# hdnet-standards
Forces HDNET's coding standards on commits

## Usage
- create a captainhook.json in the main project (Example: captainhookSample.json)
- Change the Project's Jiraticket (XXX in line 17)
- [Usually you would need to `vendor/bin/captainhook configure`, but creating the captainhook.json by hand does that for you]
- Activate captainhook with `vendor/bincaptainhook install`
